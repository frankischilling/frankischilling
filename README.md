### Hello World!

I am an IT student, technician, and a Linux enjoyer! 

I also like to mess around with programming too. 

Please check out cupidfetch if you are interested in C Linux programming.

I'm learning: 
* C, Java, Rust
* Unix, GNU/Linux, CLI Tools, TUI Tools
* Some light web-dev (PHP, MySQL, XAMPP)

I'm interested in:
* Arch GNU/Linux
* FOSS, and more!

**frankischilling/frankischilling** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
